Use forelse loop rather foreach
You can use for forelse loop in your application.

Instead of doing this 

@if ($users->count())
  @foreach ($users as $user)

This is user {{ $user->id }}

  @endforeach
@else

No users found.

@endif

You may use

@forelse ($users as $user)

This is user {{ $user->id }}

@empty

No users found.

@endforelse
